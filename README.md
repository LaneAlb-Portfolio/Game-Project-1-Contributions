# Game-Project-1-Contributions
A better looking github pages version of my contribution write to make it easy to read


- My contributions to ‘Awesome Name Goes Here’ were as follows; design of level 2 and 
some modeling for level 3. The design of level 2 entails, creating the layout, 
environment, all particle effects, 1 animation, as well as placing all assets in the 
scene. The platform models were designed by a team member and I manipulated the original
 model to make the elongated platforms. All textured objects in level 2 came from me, I text
ured the rock made by a team member and the terrain textures were 
painted using the tools from the unity plugin. The ceiling of the volcano was made 
using an arch in probuilder and multiplying the texture up to create a dark overhang. 
The flowing lava animation was taken from the creators of the lava texture who had a 
script premade, I just manipulated the texture to better fit the space. All of the lava
particle effects or lighting effects were taken from the unity standard assets or the
asset store. For the lava effects themselves, I used point lights at differing hues 
to give a subtle glow throughout the level. For the combustions that flowed with the 
lava, I took a flame particle effect and randomized its nature along a box area from 
right to left. This created several flaming combustions as the lava flowed in the same 
direction. I found a spark particle effect that was within another flame particle 
prefab and duplicated it into the lava to add some life to certain spots of the lava. 
There is a monster waving at you when you enter the level, this monster uses the eyes 
and tentacles found in level 1. The other tentacles and eyes throughout the level are 
also taken from level 1 and the eye animations were done by another team member. The 
monster’s simple waving animation was done by me in unity, and his “breath” is a fire 
spout effect slowed down and manipulated along a conic path. The colorful fireflies 
surrounding the exit were found within our imports and placed behind the door to create
a glowing rainbow visual to indicate an objective. The entire level is covered in 
invisible planes to create a non-climbable environment for the players along the 
volcano. I did most of the heavy lifting with these invisible walls in level 2 and 
had another team member help me bug test and adjust them if needed. The eyes along the tentacles 
were manipulated copies of the level 1 eyes. There are also red point lights on the 
tentacles to emphasize them. For level 3, I made the potted plants around the house, 
and textured 7 items. I made 2 versions of the potted plants, one was the stand alone 
bigger plant for downstairs and the smaller, scalable pots for upstairs that would 
sit in the bedroom corners and on the desks. I used the matrix extrude option on just 
the dome of a capsule to create the stand-alone plants downstairs. The desk plants 
were made using matrix extrude on an oil drum’s top that I rotated so that all the 
planes faced upwards. The pot and plant were then textured and placed into the level. 
I found numerous textures over the lifespan of the project in order to texture the 
couch, tv, the nightstands in the bedrooms, tv stand, doors, windows, and barstool. 
I made 3 different window textures for variety by manipulating or adding onto the 
original texture page I made. I created one where the fake window image was burning 
and another to let eyes be placed on the window.
